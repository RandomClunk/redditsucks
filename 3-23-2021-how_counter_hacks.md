If you see a hacker that has binoculars, they likely don't know what their normal view range is. Try to act like you don't see them and when they get close, attack.
As for the aimbot, it's pretty bad for everything but SMG. Currently, it aims from you, the hacker, to the middle of the player, the target. Since your gun in offset to the side, this causes it to end up aiming to the target's left edge relative to you. I have found a fix for this and will implement it soon.

Bottom player has aimbot on<br>

I would still call it aimbot not aim assist. Below is aim assist.

Gun's path is blocked<br>

The prediction factor has some work to be done on. First, I need to make it disableable. Second, currently, your speed + the targets speed is factored in as well. I need to make factors for those adjustable too. Lastly, still need to factor in
- ping
- gun range
- bullet speed
- bullet spread
- range/accuracy perks
No plans for adding them in yet tho.
The hack is oudated and has been fore roughly 8 months.
<br>No plans on a re-rwrite but I can make a custom client for gats that would be minimal and fast.<br>
Currently working on auto-shield.
